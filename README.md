## Notes
#### Here‚Äôs a summary of the challenges I encountered while building the Sea Monster Crowdfunding app

### üíª JavaScript Functionality
- Needed to revisit key JavaScript methods like reduce, filter, and sort for data manipulation.
- String literals and the ternary operator for cleaner, more dynamic code.
- Figuring out how to pass data values between functions was tricky, especially when chaining logic or updating the DOM.

### üìÅ Data Handling
 - Learning how to read data from a .json file and properly parse it.
 - Implementing filtering logic based on user input (e.g., showing funded vs. unfunded games) required careful handling of conditions and array methods.

### üõ† Debugging & Output
 - console.log() was a lifesaver‚Äîit helped track variable values and understand what was happening at each step of execution.

### üåê GitHub Workflow
 - Encountered issues with pulling and pushing changes due to repository privacy settings.
 - The error was resolved by switching the GitHub account or repository to public, allowing commits and pushes to go through.
